  - Are any work items aging or blocked?
  - Is WIP within limits?
  - How can we improve flow today?

#### Sprint Review
- **Enhancement:** Include flow performance data alongside the demonstration of the Increment.
- **Purpose:** Discuss how flow performance affects value delivery.

#### Sprint Retrospective
- **Enhancement:** Analyze bottlenecks, delays, WIP breaches, and flow efficiency to inform improvement actions.

---

### Artifacts

#### Sprint Backlog
- **Enhancement:** Includes WIP limits, current flow metrics, and aging items.
- **Purpose:** Facilitate better flow monitoring and in-Sprint adaptation.

#### Product Backlog
- **Enhancement:** May include flow-related attributes such as estimated cycle time or aging status.

#### Increment
- **Note:** Not modified by Kanban, but expected to reflect improved delivery flow and cadence.

---

### Evaluation

#### Exam Format
- **Type:** Multiple choice and true/false
- **Focus:** Integration of Kanban principles into Scrum, flow metrics, and practical application in real teams.

## **Professional Scrum with User Experience I (PSU I)**

**Focus:** Integrating UX practices with Scrum to deliver user-centric, valuable products through continuous discovery and empirical feedback

---

### Principles

#### Continuous UX
- **Description:** UX work is not a separate phase but an integral part of every Sprint.
- **Implication:** UX research, design, and testing happen alongside development, enabling continuous discovery and delivery.

#### Shared Understanding
- **Description:** All members of the Scrum Team collaborate in UX-related activities to create a shared understanding of user needs.
- **Goal:** Break down silos between UX designers, developers, and Product Owners.

#### Empirical UX Learning
- **Description:** UX decisions evolve through experimentation, validated learning, and adaptation.
- **Approach:** Use rapid feedback loops to guide design and implementation.

---

### Accountabilities

#### Product Owner
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Prioritize UX research and learning in the Product Backlog
  - Align UX insights with business outcomes and goals
  - Validate assumptions through user feedback

#### Developers
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Participate in user research, testing, and design discussions
  - Collaborate with UX specialists (if present)
  - Build and refine solutions based on user insights

#### Scrum Master
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Promote integration of UX work into Sprints
  - Support empirical UX learning within the team
  - Remove impediments related to UX collaboration

---

### Practices

#### UX Activities within Sprints
- **Examples:**
  - User interviews
  - Usability testing
  - Sketching and prototyping
  - Journey mapping
  - Design critique sessions

#### Dual-Track Agile
- **Description:** Product discovery and product delivery happen in parallel tracks, connected by shared Sprint Goals.
- **Goal:** Enable fast learning without delaying delivery.

#### Hypothesis-Driven Development
- **Description:** Frame features and designs as hypotheses to be tested.
- **Format:** 
  - "We believe that [doing this] will result in [this outcome] for [these users] based on [this evidence]."

#### Personas and Empathy Maps
- **Purpose:** Develop deep understanding of users’ motivations, goals, pain points, and behaviors.

---

### Events (UX Integration)

#### Sprint Planning
- **Integration:** Include UX discovery tasks, design validation work, and research spikes as part of Sprint scope.
- **Output:** Sprint Backlog reflects both discovery and delivery items.

#### Daily Scrum
- **Integration:** Track progress of UX tasks and coordinate with development activities.
- **Focus:** Collaboration between designers and developers to avoid handoffs.

#### Sprint Review
- **Integration:** Present UX learnings (e.g., insights from usability tests) alongside product Increment.
- **Purpose:** Align stakeholders with real user feedback.

#### Sprint Retrospective
- **Integration:** Reflect on effectiveness of UX collaboration and feedback loops.
- **Outcomes:** Improvements to how the team balances discovery and delivery.

---

### Artifacts

#### Product Backlog
- **Enhancement:** Includes research items, design experiments, and usability goals as Product Backlog Items (PBIs).
- **Types of Items:**
  - Hypotheses
  - Design validation tasks
  - Discovery spikes
  - UX research results

#### Sprint Backlog
- **Content:** Contains UX and technical tasks with shared ownership

#### Increment
- **Note:** May include prototypes, validated ideas, and research findings—not only working code

---

### Evaluation

#### Exam Format
- **Type:** Multiple choice and true/false
- **Focus:** Integration of UX practices into Scrum, empirical learning, discovery inside Sprints

## **Professional Product Discovery and Validation (PPDV)**

**Focus:** Discovering, validating, and integrating product ideas before and during delivery using Scrum

---

### Principles

#### Discovery Through Empiricism
- **Description:** Product decisions are improved through evidence, not assumptions.

#### Continuous Discovery
- **Description:** Discovery happens inside Sprints, alongside delivery.

#### Hypothesis-Driven Thinking
- **Description:** Product ideas are testable assumptions to be validated or invalidated.

---

### Accountabilities

#### Product Owner
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Identify and prioritize discovery opportunities
  - Frame assumptions as hypotheses
  - Use validation results to guide backlog decisions

#### Developers
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Participate in discovery experiments and ideation
  - Help evaluate feasibility and learning effort

---

### Practices

#### Hypothesis Writing
- **Format:** "We believe that... will result in... for... based on..."

#### Experiment Design
- **Techniques:**
  - A/B testing
  - MVPs (Minimum Viable Products)
  - Fake Door tests
  - Usability testing
  - Prototypes and mockups

#### Discovery Items in Backlog
- **Description:** Include user interviews, data collection, test runs, and design validations as PBIs

#### Learning-Focused Metrics
- **Examples:**
  - Conversion rates
  - Activation and retention signals
  - Feedback quality
  - Confidence level improvement

---

### Events

#### Sprint Planning
- **Enhancement:** Incorporate learning objectives and discovery tasks into Sprint Goal

#### Sprint Review
- **Enhancement:** Present insights from experiments and validated learning

#### Retrospective

---

### Integration Rules

#### Discovery and Delivery
- **Description:** Both occur within the Sprint; discovery is not a separate phase

#### Shared Understanding
